### Hi, I'm Eli,

I'm on the road to become a junior fullstack webdeveloper. I have a background in music production and a bit of graphic design.
To be honest I only have scratched the surface of coding in general but, with every project my motivation becomes stronger to learn more.

A website should breathe life into the screen of the user and take them on the journey the client wants.
